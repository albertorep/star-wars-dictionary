# 🌌 Star Wars Explorer

A fully responsive Angular 19 application that consumes the [SWAPI.tech](https://swapi.tech) and [Akabab Star Wars API](https://akabab.github.io/starwars-api/) to display Star Wars resources with filters, infinite scroll or pagination, dark mode, mobile navigation, and an animated expanded detail view.

> This project was built entirely for fun and practice. May the Force be with you.
